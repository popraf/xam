# xam

### About
This is just a gambling coin.

### How does it work
1 USDT equals 1 XAM. Using XAM bet against price of ETH in next 5 seconds - guess price increase, decrease, or stay the same (short, long, no change).
If guessed correctly, you receive almost doubled bet price (80% of bet), otherwise bet is lost. If the bet is lost, tokens are burned.

### Token economy
First 1'000'000 tokens are minted by exchanging USDT to XAM with 1:1 ratio.
After reaching this threshold, XAM tokens price ratio will decrease twice each 1'000'000 tokens exchanged
(e.g. 4'000'001 token is going to be sold for 1:8 ratio, meaning 8 USDT for 1 XAM).
Each transfer to another wallet costs 10% of sent amount, except for staking addresses.
